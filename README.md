# cms
Brief Documentation.
For the implementation of the projects, I did a extreme programming methodology.I use my wife’s opinion and I continue developing the tasks!  
I start implementing the tasks at Friday night and I finish Monday around 1:00. The tasks where demanding due to time limit! But all are done and at working. All are at my github repository at https://github.com/iacovosi/cms.git
For this tasks I used Laravel 5.6 and mysql database behind. In addition, I develop a script to run the laravel in bash the generate.sh.
For the front end I used the bootstrap 4 with font awesome and I implement the page as it looks!  Also I created a layout with 3 sections. 1 for css / 1 for js / and one for the body. I try to use this structure at my web apps.
Now let my write how I solve the tasks:
•	For the categories I created seeder files
•	Also 1 create 3 models the User/ Category / Posts with migration files.
•	I used routing, controllers, blade views, models etc…
•	I used also the auth middleware with the auth fetatures of Laravel!
•	Also I used ajax with api routes to auto update the status.
•	For the WYSIWYG I used tinymce
•	Datatables with Jquery ui sortable element in order to sort the posts as you like!
•	For the second task I used curl to get the page and dom-crawel (composer require symfony/dom-crawler) to parse html and get title / url / link /picture .. etc…

All tasks are done !  I hope you are happy with the work done! I am 
